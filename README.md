# portfolio-star-wars-api

I wanted to add a API to my portfolio to show my abillity to use public APIs and build something.  I landed on making some cards for each character available in the [People](https://swapi.dev/api/people/) API.  There are a lot of characters with a bunch of information that _could_ lead to something cool.  Right now, I am fetching and scraping to put together a JSON object with all the information I want to use.

I'll add more to this as I go, still a lot to work through.
